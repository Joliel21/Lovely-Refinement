            "text": "Have you ever watched someone you admire suddenly face a health challenge that changes everything?\nChristina Applegate, the actress we've loved for decades, got life-changing news in 2021. The actress, whose impressive career includes a Primetime Emmy Award and four Golden Globe nominations [6] —was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). [5] And she's been incredibly open about what this means for her daily life.\nMS is a disease of the central nervous system that affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. [24] The disease, affecting nearly one million Americans, is three times more common in women than men, and usually shows up between ages 20 and 40. [1]\nDiagnostic scans showed that Christina has 30 lesions on her brain, characteristic markers of MS that occur when the disease affects the central nervous system. [1] The impact has been huge, eventually requiring her to use a wheelchair to complete the final season of her show.[5]\nThat's when she made a difficult decision about her career.\nChristina, who previously battled and beat breast cancer at age 36 back in 2008, [6] announced she would step away from appearing on screen, though she plans to continue voice work. [6]\nChristina's journey shows us how someone can face a major health challenge with courage and honesty. She's not hiding from what's happening to her.",

[5]\nMost of us would probably brush that off, right?\nThe actual diagnosis came on an ordinary Monday. “They did an MRI in my brain, and it was a Monday, and we were at work. And my doctor said, ‘I really need to get on a Zoom with you to go over your MRI results,'” Christina recalled. [1]\nWhat happened next was devastating.\n“And I opened up my Zoom and there he was, and he just looked at me and he goes, ‘I'm so sorry.' And I was like, ‘What do you mean?' And he goes, ‘Here's a picture of your brain, sorry.' And there's like 30 lesions all over my brain. And I went, ‘No, please don't tell me this. Please don't.'”  [1]\nCan you imagine?",

[1] The symptoms would disappear for months, making them easy to ignore.\nThat's the tricky thing about MS—it can hide in plain sight.\nIt wasn't until things got much worse that Christina finally sought medical attention. Her friend and fellow actress Selma Blair, who has MS herself, encouraged her to get tested. [1] By summer 2021, while filming the final season of the show, Christina's condition had changed dramatically. She arrived on set in a wheelchair because she couldn't walk to her trailer. [5]",

[19]\nAt home, Sadie pushes her mom to do things that feel hard. “She's like, ‘You're going down all the steps,'” Christina explains. Even when Christina doesn't want to, she does it anyway. Why? “I do it because I know she's checking in to make sure, ‘Can she still take care of me?'” [20]\nThat's a 14-year-old worrying about whether her mom can still be her mom. It's heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time.\nWhat makes their bond even stronger is that Sadie has her own health challenges. She's been diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).[4] Sadie put it perfectly when she said, “I feel like if I didn't have this thing it would be a lot harder to understand what my mom's going through.” [4]\nChristina is incredibly honest about what motivates her each day.\n“I get up [in the morning] because of [Sadie].” [19] “She's the reason I'm still here and trying.” [21]\nBut their relationship isn't without its painful moments. Sadie once told her mom something that cut deep: “I missed who you were before you got sick.” Christina described hearing that as “a knife to the heart.”",

She could have kept it private. She could have put on a brave face and pretended everything was fine. Instead, she's shown us what it actually looks like to live with an invisible illness.\nHer MeSsy podcast with Jamie-Lynn Sigler has become something special. It's not polished or perfect—it's real conversations between two women figuring out how to live with MS. That authenticity is helping other people feel less alone.\nIt's inspiring how Christina has found her purpose in this difficult situation. Chronic illness changes your life, but it doesn't have to end it. Sometimes life forces us down a different path, and we have to learn how to find meaning in unexpected places. The hardest things we go through can become the very things that help us help others.\nThat's courage. That's choosing to let people see you as you really are, even when it's messy and difficult and not what you planned.",

It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath surrounding nerve fibers in your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. This interference disrupts the communication between your brain and the rest of your body.\nHow common is the disease, and who is most at risk?\nNearly one million Americans live with MS. It is approximately three times more common in women than men and is most frequently diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 40.\nWhat are some early warning signs of MS?",

            "text": "Christina noted subtle symptoms years before her diagnosis, including tingling in her toes and her leg occasionally “buckling.” Because these signs can disappear for months at a time, they are often easily dismissed as simple fatigue or dehydration.\nWhat are “lesions,” and why are they significant?\nLesions are areas of scar tissue or damage on the brain or spinal cord caused by the disease. The location of these lesions often dictates the symptoms. For example, a lesion behind the optic nerve can cause significant eye pain, as in Christina's case.\nWhy do experts emphasize early detection?\nMedical research shows that starting treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis can slow down irreversible neurological damage. Early intervention helps reduce the frequency of “flares” and can help manage long-term disability.\nWhat does it mean when MS is called an “invisible disease”?\nMany of the most debilitating symptoms—like excruciating nerve pain, extreme fatigue, and cognitive “brain fog”—cannot be seen by others. A person may look healthy on the outside while experiencing a “hellish” internal reality, which can lead to feelings of isolation.\nHow does MS fatigue differ from being “just tired”?\nMS fatigue is often described as overwhelming exhaustion that isn't cured by a good night's sleep.",
